# GRASP-BAP-and-YAP
This subproject is an integral part of the Development of Optimization and Simulation Models for the Integration of the Tubar√£o Port System project. In this subproject, we are interested in studying combinatorial optimization techniques and their adaptation to the integrated problem of optimizing the berth allocation and the yard allocation in the context of port bulk export terminals. For this, we seek to deepen the studies of the problems of berth allocation and yard allocation, adapting for its resolution, techniques from the literature of Graph Theory and Combinatorial Optimization. We aim to continue the studies already carried out on the subject, seeking new methods of solving the problem, in order to evaluate and compare their performance.
